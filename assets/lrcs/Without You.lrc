[00:18.14]You said that we would always be
[00:21.12]
[00:21.88]Without you I feel lost at sea
[00:24.64]
[00:25.17]Through the darkness you'd hide with me
[00:28.65]Like the wind we'd be wild and free
[00:31.83]
[00:32.39]You
[00:34.65]Said you'd follow me anywhere
[00:38.93]But your eyes
[00:41.31]
[00:42.09]Tell me you won't be there
[00:45.06]
[00:46.07]I've gotta learn how to love without you
[00:49.05]
[00:49.60]I've gotta carry my cross without you
[00:53.19]Stuck in a riddle and I'm just about to
[00:56.31]
[00:57.31]Figure it out without you
[00:59.91]
[01:00.65]And I'm done sitting home without you
[01:03.41]
[01:04.51]F**k I'm going out without you
[01:07.04]
[01:07.60]I'm gonna tear this city down without you
[01:10.53]
[01:11.10]I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you
[01:14.78]
[01:29.80]Now I'm running away my dear
[01:33.14]From myself and the truth I fear
[01:36.59]My heart is beating I can't see clear
[01:40.30]How I'm wishing that you were here
[01:43.98]You
[01:46.21]Said you'd follow me anywhere
[01:50.51]But your eyes
[01:53.25]
[01:53.88]Tell me you won't be there
[01:56.83]
[01:57.74]I've gotta learn how to love without you
[02:00.72]
[02:01.23]I've gotta carry my cross without you
[02:04.88]Stuck in a riddle and I'm just about to
[02:07.80]
[02:09.01]Figure it out without you
[02:11.56]
[02:12.26]And I'm done sitting home without you
[02:14.98]
[02:16.10]F**k I'm going out without you
[02:18.62]
[02:19.19]I'm gonna tear this city down without you
[02:22.16]
[02:22.77]I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you
