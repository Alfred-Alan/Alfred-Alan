[02:41.30]From far away
[02:43.30]In mountains deep
[02:45.22]The night of blood
[02:47.23]In twilight sleep
[02:49.22]The armies fight
[02:51.23]For king and queen

[02:55.24]No victory
[02:57.21]The swords collide
[02:59.30]With power and force
[03:01.27]As mighty men

[04:37.22]As mighty men
[04:39.25]Show no remorse
[04:41.21]It is the time
[04:43.33]The snow is melting
[04:45.27]It is the time
