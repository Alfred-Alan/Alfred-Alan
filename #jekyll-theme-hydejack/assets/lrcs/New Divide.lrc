[00:00.00]New Divide (重生阵线) - Linkin Park (林肯公园)
[00:17.69]Written by：Linkin Park
[00:35.38]I remembered black skies
[00:37.61]The lightning all around me
[00:42.17]
[00:43.53]I remembered each flash as time began to blur
[00:50.11]
[00:51.40]Like a startling sign that fate had finally found me
[00:58.43]
[00:59.38]And your voice was all I heard
[01:03.47]That I get what I deserve
[01:07.04]So give me reason to prove me wrong
[01:12.08]To wash this memory clean
[01:15.25]Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
[01:23.34]Give me reason to fill this hole
[01:28.33]Connect the space between
[01:30.97]
[01:31.53]Let it be enough to reach the truth
[01:36.18]That lies across this new divide
[01:44.94]
[01:48.63]There was nothing in sight
[01:50.83]But memories left abandoned
[01:55.70]
[01:56.55]There was nowhere to hide
[01:58.86]The ashes fell like snow
[02:04.03]
[02:04.66]And the ground caved in between
[02:07.65]Where we were standing
[02:12.80]And your voice was all I heard
[02:16.69]That I get what I deserve
[02:20.20]So give me reason to prove me wrong
[02:25.31]To wash this memory clean
[02:28.47]Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
[02:35.56]Across this new divide
[02:38.63]
[02:52.99]In every loss in every lie
[02:56.80]In every truth that you'd deny
[03:00.84]And each regret and each goodbye
[03:04.89]Was a mistake too great to hide
[03:08.90]
[03:09.65]And your voice was all I heard
[03:13.66]That I get what I deserve
[03:17.11]So give me reason to prove me wrong
[03:22.23]To wash this memory clean
[03:25.45]Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
[03:33.07]
[03:33.59]Give me reason to fill this hole
[03:38.55]Connect the space between
[03:41.18]
[03:41.70]Let it be enough to reach the truth
[03:46.25]That lies across this new divide
[03:55.96]
[03:57.00]Across this new divide
[04:03.32]
[04:05.11]Across this new divide
