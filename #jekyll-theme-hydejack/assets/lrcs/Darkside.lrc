[00:14.29]We're not in love

[00:16.97]We share no stories

[00:19.85]Just something in your eyes

[00:25.51]Don't be afraid

[00:28.34]The shadows know me

[00:31.12]Let's leave the world behind

[00:36.58]Take me through the night

[00:38.90]Fall into the dark side

[00:42.69]We don't need the light

[00:44.51]We'll live on the dark side

[00:48.05]I see it

[00:49.47]Let's feel it

[00:50.83]While we're still young and fearless

[00:53.41]Let go of the light

[00:55.99]Fall into the dark side

[01:07.78]Give into the dark side

[01:16.27]Let go of the light

[01:18.39]Fall into the dark side

[01:22.28]Beneath the sky

[01:24.81]As black as diamonds

[01:27.54]We're running out of time

[01:33.25]Don't wait for truth

[01:36.03]To come and blind us

[01:38.81]Let's just believe their lies

[01:44.62]Believe it I see it

[01:47.35]I know that you can feel it

[01:50.12]No secrets worth keeping

[01:53.00]So fool me like I'm dreaming

[01:55.74]Take me through the night

[01:57.96]Fall into the dark side
