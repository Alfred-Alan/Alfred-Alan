[00:02.95]Lost in your mind

[00:09.46]I wanna know

[00:11.99]Am I losing my mind

[00:19.22]Never let me go

[00:21.19]If this night is not forever

[00:24.67]At least we are together

[00:27.10]I know I'm not alone

[00:29.42]I know I'm not alone

[00:32.52]Anywhere whenever

[01:33.13]If this night is not forever

[01:36.38]At least we are together

[01:38.86]I know I'm not alone

[01:41.23]I know I'm not alone
